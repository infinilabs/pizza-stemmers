# Pizza stemmers (tokenizer)

This library bundles several OSS to provide a collection of stemming algorithms for various languages as a Pizza tokenizer. 
[Pizza](https://github.com/infinilabs/pizza) is a distributed Real-Time Search & AI-Native innovation engine that written in Rust. 
This library originally forked from [tantivy-stemmers](https://github.com/testuj-to/tantivy-stemmers) by testuj-to.

This library compiles several OSS projects into 1 library:
- [`snowballstem/snowball`](https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball)

  All the raw algorithms in this library are written in the [Snowball](https://snowballstem.org) language, then complied into a Rust code using the Snowball compiler - all these generated algorithms are located at `src/snowball/algorithms/*`. 
- A Snowball *environment* is then needed to execute the generated algorithm. This environment is comprised of files `src/snowball/among.rs` and `src/snowball/env.rs` - both files have been provided (ie. copied) from the official Snowball repository: [`rust/src/snowball`](https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball/tree/master/rust).

- **Algorithms**

  Most, if not all, stemming algorithms are obtained from the official [Snowball website](https://snowballstem.org) and compiled using the Snowball compiler into Rust. More information about individual algorithm licenses are noted below - most are published under the BSD license.

## Cargo features

As this library bundles many algorithms and contains lots of generated code, it would be nice not to have to include it all in our final build. 
For this reason, each algorithm is published as a Cargo feature. In order to use a specific algorithm, you have to install the appropriate feature first. 
By `default` enabled all algorithms, adjust your own feature on purpose:

```toml
#Â ...
[dependencies]
pizza-stemmers = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["default"] }
#Â ...
```

**See the features table under [Supported algorithms](#supported-algorithms) below.**

- **Polish**

  While there are a few distinct stemming algorithms for the Polish language, there's not a single Polish (OSS) stemming algorithm implemented in the Snowball language. Namely, the most popular stemming algorithm [Stempel](http://www.getopt.org/stempel) is implemented in Java. There are also its ports to [Python](https://github.com/dzieciou/pystempel) and [Go](https://github.com/blevesearch/stempel).

  There is 1 Polish stemming algorithm with 2 variants in this library: `polish_yarovoy` and `polish_yarovoy_unaccented`. It has been ported to Rust from a [Go implementation](https://github.com/nickspring/simple_polish_stemmer) by **Nikolay Yarovoy**, which in turn was inspired by [Python implementation](https://github.com/Tutanchamon/pl_stemmer) by **BÅ‚aÅ¼ej KubiÅ„ski**.<br>
  There are 2 variants of this algorithm: `polish_yarovoy` stems Polish words and leaves accents as are, while the `polish_yarovoy_unaccented` stems Polish words and also removes all the accents.

  The Turkish Snowball algorithm was developed by **Evren (Kapusuz) Ã‡ilden** in 2007. The source code has been obtained under the BSD license from the official [Snowball website](https://snowballstem.org/algorithms/turkish/stemmer.html).

  ##### Note from the Snowball website

  > The Turkish stemming algorithm was provided by Evren Kapusuz Cilden. It stems only noun and nominal verb suffixes because noun stems are more important for information retrieval, and only handling these simplifies the algorithm significantly.

  > In her paper (linked above) Evren explains

  > The stemmer can be enhanced to stem all kinds of verb suffixes. In Turkish, there are over fifty suffixes that can be affixed to verbs [2]. The morphological structure of verb suffixes is more complicated than noun suffixes. Despite this, one can use the methodology presented in this paper to enhance the stemmer to find stems of all kinds of Turkish words.

- **Yiddish**

  The Yiddish Snowball algorithm was created by Assaf Urieli in 2020 and obtained under the BSD license from the official [Snowball website](https://snowballstem.org/algorithms/yiddish/stemmer.html).
